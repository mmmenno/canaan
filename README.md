CreAtive Nodes in Amsterdamâ€™s Artefact-actor Networks

The aim of the proposed project is to mashup data from two (and eventually more) distributed cultural heritage resources in a single research tool. The resources in question are the digital [collection catalog of the Amsterdam Museum](http://am.adlibhosting.com/) and the [ECARTICO database](http://vondel.humanities.uva.nl/ecartico/) of the University of Amsterdam (UvA).
